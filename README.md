# TaskManager-Server
Project Description: Express based server using JavaScript and Postgre

This project is the development of a server application using the Express framework, the JavaScript programming language and the Postgre database. The project includes authorization functionality, user registration and a task management system for each user.

Main features of the project:

1. Authorization and registration: The server implements mechanisms for authorization and registration of users. Users can create accounts, log into their accounts using appropriate credentials, and manage their data.

2. Task management: Registered users can create, view, update and delete their tasks. For this, a Postgre database is used, where information about tasks is stored in the corresponding table.

3. RESTful API: The server is developed in accordance with the principles of the RESTful API, which ensures easy interaction with client applications and the ability to use various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform data operations.

4. Data validation: Before saving data to the database, the server checks for the correctness and validity of the transmitted data. This prevents incorrect or invalid values from being stored in the database.

5. Error and Exception Handling: The server provides error and exception handling and output to prevent failures and provide the user with an informative error message when problems occur.

6. Scalability: The project is built using Express, which provides a modular structure and ease of adding new features and functionality in the future.

An Express-based server project using JavaScript and Postgre provides a convenient and secure way for registered users to manage tasks. It provides a solid foundation for developing client applications and interacting with a Postgre database.
